# Specification of ShuLang Intermediate Representation (SIR)

SIR the IR for ShuLang and utilizes SSA form. Hence all variables get assigned to **once**.

I think most of the stuff in here is pretty self explanitory (as I lifted it from LLVM). I'm assuming that if you're here you either have no idea what you're doing and are poking around the repository, or you're a hardened veteran who has spotted 100 different inconsistencies.

This specification was last updated during Act 2. Any changes past that point will not be reflected here.

## Concrete Syntax

statements ::= `name <- value` | `jump to block` | `jump to block if condition else block` | `print(value)`

boolean ::= `true` | `false`

immediate ::= `$number`
- Number is a number

variable_reference ::= `%identifier`

cmp ::=  `x > y` | `x >= y` | `x < y` | `x <= y`  | `x = y` | `x != y` | `x and y` | `x or y` | `x xor y`
- Boolean comparison
- `x` and `y` should be booleans

binary_arithmatic ::= `x + y` | `x * y` | `x - y` 
- Basically just math
- `x` and `y` should be immediates

values ::= immediates | variable_reference | binary_arithmatic | cmp | `Î¦ [block, value], ...` | `Select x y z`
- for select, `x` has to be a boolean, and `y, z` have to have the same type


## Abstract syntax

Statements ::= `Definition(name, value)` | `print(variable)` | `Jump(destination)` | `JumpIfElse(destination, else_destination, condition)`

Cmp ::= `x > y` | `x >= y` | `x < y` | `x <= y`  | `x = y` | `x != y` | `x and y` | `x or y` | `x xor y`
- `x` and `y` have a width of 1
- Putting this in prefix looks weird, hence me maintaining the infix notation
    - Cry about it

BinOp ::= `add(x, y)` | `mult(x, y)` | `sub(x, y)`
- `x` and `y` have a width of 8

Values ::=  BinOp | Cmp | `Reference(identifier)` | `PhiNode({(predecesor_block, value), ...})` | `Immediate(number, width)` | `Select(condition, true_value, false_value)`
